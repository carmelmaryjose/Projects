Files in Submission:

	-hpd.c
	-hpde.h
	-hpde.c
	-user.c
	-prg.sh
	-Makefile

Objective: 
	- Developed platform driver for dual HC-SR04 sensors for initiation as platform and miscellaneous devices and enabled sysfs interface for setting and reading various parameters

Instructions for compiling the program:

	1. Compile the Makefile and cross compile the device driver and main program by using the command `make`
	2. `chmod +x prg.sh`
	3. Copy the following files to the galileo board using the following command `sudo scp filename root@'ip_of_device':/home`
		-hpd.ko
		-hpde.ko
		-hpde.h
		-user
		-prg.sh
	2. Insert the module hpd.ko into the kernel by using command `insmod hpd.ko n=1` where n is the number of devices
	3. Insert the module hpde.ko using command `insmod hpde.ko` 
	4. Run the program by command `./prg.sh`
	5. Follow the program instructions to enter the trigger and echo pins, samples per measurement and sampling period
