A Device Driver for HC-SR04

Files in Submission:

	User Level File: user.c
	Driver files: gpiod.c
	Makefile: Makefile

Objectives:
	- Familiarized with the basic programming techniques in Linux GPIO kernel modules, GPIO pin multiplexing and TSC clock 
	  and software structures of kernel timer and GPIO interrupts

Instructions for compiling the program:

	1. Compile the Makefile and cross compile by using the command `make`
	2. scp the following files to the galileo board
		-gpiod.ko
		-user
	2. Insert the gpiod.ko into the kernel by using command `insmod gpiod.ko n=2` where n is the number of devices
	3. Run the program by command `./user`
	4. Follow the user program instructions to enter the trigger and echo pins, samples per measurement and sampling period
